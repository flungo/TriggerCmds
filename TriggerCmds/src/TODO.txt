To do:

    Add more triggers (maybe pressure plates)
    Make a command to delete the link and keep the command on Db
    onBreak deletes link
    User groups (I might put it... still not sure) (tks @QuackzMcDuck )
    Add a fakePlayer to overwrite permissions (tks @QuackzMcDuck )
    Link the triggers with redstone (I have to find a cool way)
    Timed commands (maybe!! I guess ^^)
	Limit how many times a player can trigger a button (with player use reset command)
	Limit how many times a trigger can be pressed before self unlinking. Variable to choose if button unlinks or stops executing
	Add "execute" command to execute button from anywhere
	Add permissions for each type of button and execution
	Levers have an on and off command
	Expand permissions
	Add configuration
	Batch import from file (yml array)
    Check all tReg fields are used and implemented fully.
